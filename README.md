# Npc_Builder
A Customizable Random NPC Generator, Non system specific, generator is what this project was supposed to be, but that turned out to be too ambitious.

The project now is more a 'proof-of-concept' that I can use Java, Sql, and Spring to create an npc builder. It is still my intent to figure out how to turn this thing into a random generator, and then to add
more functionality like city builder, faction builder, etc... As well as adding some admin functionality like logins/useraccounts. But I have unfortunately run out of time, even with an extension. So this project
showcases that I can access each of my tables, and perform CRUD operations on each of them, as well as performing each of the CRUD operations on a single table (my npcs table).
